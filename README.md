# Ghost (V1) #
Mode 2 - Ghost FPV Racing Frame

# About #
The Mode 2 Ghost, inspired by the original Floss, was designed to be as lightweight as possible while featuring many improvements over the Floss.  With The RCAddict's input as far as key features and requests, The Ghost was the first FPV racing frame that we released.

The Ghost was code-named the F1 during its inception and development, as such you may find F1 naming conventions without the source or files.  Below you will be able to view the different variations
of the Ghost designs before the final release.
